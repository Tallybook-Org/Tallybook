// Submit verifies sc (via VerifyCommitment, simulating prepare_commitment
// against channel) and durably persists the result — valid or not —
// before returning, so the row exists in Postgres before any caller
// acknowledges the payer (§6 ordering rule 1: "Persist before
// acknowledging"). It never acts on the commitment beyond recording it;
// deciding whether to settle against a Record is the settler's job,
// against rows this method has already made durable (ordering rule 2:
// Record.Valid is exactly the gate "never settle against an unverified
// commitment" depends on).
//
// If verification does not complete at all — a malformed argument, or the
// prepare_commitment simulation itself failing — Submit persists nothing
// and returns an error wrapping ErrVerificationIncomplete: ordering rule 2
// is "verify before storing", and an incomplete verification has no
// outcome yet to store. This is different from a completed verification
// that finds the commitment invalid, which Submit does persist — per §6's
// failure handling ("A commitment that fails verification: store it, mark
// it invalid, alert, never settle against it"): an invalid commitment is
// still evidence (of a bug, an attack, or a stale signer key) and must not
// be silently dropped, only prevented from being settled against.
//
// A retry with the exact same (channel, cumulative_amount) is safe:
// commitments' UNIQUE(channel, cumulative_amount) constraint (§5) makes a
// second Submit for the same pair a read of the existing row
// (Record.AlreadyRecorded = true) rather than an error or a duplicate
// write — so a payer's retry after an acknowledgement was lost to a crash
// cannot fail spuriously or double-record anything.
//
// A cumulative_amount lower than the channel's highest already stored is
// rejected by the database's own monotonic trigger before the row is
// written at all; Submit surfaces that as an error wrapping
// ErrMonotonicViolation.
